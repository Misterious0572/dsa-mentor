## Technology Stack

### Frontend
- **React 19** with TypeScript
- **React Router** for navigation
- **Socket.io Client** for real-time communication
- **Recharts** for progress visualization
- **React Hot Toast** for notifications
- **Lucide React** for icons
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling

### Backend
- **Node.js** with Express
- **MongoDB** with Mongoose ODM
- **Socket.io** for real-time communication
- **JWT** for authentication
- **bcrypt** for password hashing
- **Speakeasy** for MFA/TOTP
- **QRCode** generation for MFA setup
- **Helmet** for security headers
- **CORS** for cross-origin requests
- **Rate Limiting** for API protection

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ 
- MongoDB (local installation or MongoDB Atlas)

### Installation

1. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start MongoDB**
   ```bash
   # If using local MongoDB
   mongod
   ```

3. **Run the Application**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

This will start both the frontend (port 5173) and backend (port 3001) concurrently.

### First Time Setup

1. **Create Account**: Register with email, password, name, and preferred programming language
2. **Enable MFA** (Optional but Recommended): Set up two-factor authentication for enhanced security
3. **Begin Journey**: Start with Day 1 of the 84-day curriculum

## Architecture

### Real-time Communication
- WebSocket connections for instant progress synchronization
- Cross-device notifications and updates
- Live coaching feedback and motivational messages

### Database Schema
- **Users**: Authentication, preferences, progress tracking
- **Progress**: Daily completion status, problem solutions, notes
- **Sessions**: Real-time connection management

### Security Features
- Password hashing with bcrypt (12 salt rounds)
- JWT tokens with 7-day expiration
- MFA with TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password)
- Rate limiting (100 requests per 15 minutes)
- CORS protection
- Security headers with Helmet
